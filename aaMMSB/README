This script is based on  Goplan et al, for the augmented assortative MMSB model, which do overlap network community detection using networks with heterogeneous attributes, both Gaussian and binary attributes type.

Installation
------------

Required libraries: gsl, gslblas, pthread, alglib, 

On Linux/Unix run

 ./configure
 make; make install



The binary 'svinet' will be installed in /usr/local/bin unless a
different prefix is provided to configure. (See INSTALL.)

Tutorial
--------

1. Prepare your network data as a tab-separated file (e.g., network.txt),Preprare seperated files for Gaussian and Binary attributes, each line is the attributes for one node. tab seperated.

2. Run the following command to find the overlapping communities: 

     svinet -file network.txt -fileGau attributes_gau.txt -fileBin attributes_bin.txt -n 17903 -k 20 -dgau 5 -dbin 4 -link-sampling

3. Run the following command to visualize the communities:
   
     cd <output-dir>; svinet -file ../network.txt  -n 10000 -k 75 -gml

In step 2, "-n" specifies the number of nodes, "-k" specifies the
number of communities and "-link-sampling" specifies the sampling
method. "-dgau" specifies the number of continous attributes, and '-dbin' specifies the number of binary attributes.
   
Step 2 writes out the communities in communities.txt, the model fit in
gamma.txt and lambda.txt and the mixed-memberships in groups.txt. ## currently, we are not predicting attributes, but it's under development. we do have attributes likelihood computed

Step 3 writes out a GML file (network.gml) that can be loaded into a
tool such as Gephi, to visualize the communities. Note that each node
is colored by its most likely community in the visualization. ## this need more work  for attributes
